**So long of GSoC and No blog yet? Why Soumya?**

Yeah, yeah, I know. Itâ€™s been a while, and no blog posts yet. But hey, between wrestling with **CFFI + C + Python** and **libcups with its 150+ APIs**, blogging kind of took the back seat. But enough excuses - letâ€™s dig into whatâ€™s been cooking.

---

## A little history (with C in it)

Back in the day (almost 15 years ago!), [**Tim Waugh**](https://github.com/twaugh) wrote the first version of `pycups` as a **C extension module for Python**. That worked well, but like all old code, it aged... letâ€™s just say, not like fine wine. After Tim, [**Zdenek**](https://github.com/zdohnal) took over as maintainer, but with multiple projects of OpenPrinting and other projects in the mix, there wasnâ€™t much room to modernize PyCups2 for him.

Fast forward to the release of **libcups3** â€” OpenPrinting needed a shiny new `pycups`, but the old codebase was a bit tooâ€¦ tangled. It was all C extensions, hard to read, harder to extend, and basically a maintenance nightmare. Thatâ€™s where I stepped in and pitched a **hybrid solution**:

ðŸ‘‰ **Use CFFI (C Foreign Function Interface)** to call libcups APIs **directly** from Python.

ðŸ‘‰ Keep the library written mostly in **pure Python**.

Why? Because:

* Python code is easier to read.
* Easier to extend and manage.
* And letâ€™s be honest â€” no one wants to debug a decade-old C extension unless they absolutely have to.

## From Classes to Mixins (and back again)

At first, I thought of a nice, clean architecture: a **base class** with protocol-specific subclasses. For example, all HTTP APIs neatly under one class.

But then reality hit: **CUPS talks to everything over HTTP.** Even IPP (Internet Printing Protocol) APIs need HTTP under the hood. So that design collapsed faster than my sleep schedule during GSoC.

Instead, I took inspiration from `pycups2` and built a single big [**`Connection` class**](https://github.com/soumyaDghosh/pycups/blob/feat-refactor/cups/connection/__init__.py). To keep it sane, I split logic into **Mixin classes**. These Mixins arenâ€™t meant to be used directly â€” they just inject methods into `Connection`, keeping the big class from becoming a 10,000-line monster.

Now you can do things like:

```python
import cups
conn = cups.Connection()
conn.encryption = HttpEncryption.ALWAYS
```

Here, the `encryption` setter just wraps a C API call via CFFI using the powerful [property decorator](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/soumyadghosh_why-i-fell-in-love-with-property-while-activity-7356164166472118275-ysfk?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAEb88BYBvz0xFt2Nk4WyZerJF0FdcaAdvog):

```python
def setEncryption(encryption: HttpEncryption):
    c_encryption = _ffi.cast("http_encryption_t", encryption.value)
    _lib.cupsSetEncryption(c_encryption)
```

Pythonic on the outside, C-powered on the inside. ðŸš€

## Making Enums Less Painful

One of the reasons this feels so much nicer is because I also **simplified enums**.

In the old world, you couldnâ€™t even do:

```python
conn = cups.Connection()
conn.encryption
```

Instead, youâ€™d get:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<python-input-2>", line 1, in <module>
    conn.encryption
AttributeError: 'cups.Connection' object has no attribute 'encryption'
```

Why? Because the old C extension didnâ€™t expose things as nice Python objects.

But now, thanks to `IntFlag` enums, you *can* read and write them like proper Python attributes:

```python
conn.encryption
HttpEncryption.IF_REQUESTED
```

And even change them dynamically:

```python
conn.encryption = cups.enums.HttpEncryption.ALWAYS
conn.encryption
<HttpEncryption.ALWAYS: 3>
```

This works because I mapped the old C macros into Python enums like this:

```python
from enum import IntFlag
from cups import _cups

_lib = _cups.lib

class HttpEncryption(IntFlag):
    IF_REQUESTED = _lib.HTTP_ENCRYPTION_IF_REQUESTED
    NEVER = _lib.HTTP_ENCRYPTION_NEVER
    REQUIRED = _lib.HTTP_ENCRYPTION_REQUIRED
    ALWAYS = _lib.HTTP_ENCRYPTION_ALWAYS
```

No more magic numbers (`0`, `1`, `2`, `3`). Instead, you get **readable, type-safe, Pythonic enums**. And since theyâ€™re `IntFlag`, they behave just like integers when passed into C, but with the bonus of clarity and bitwise flexibility if you need it.

## Meet `cupsDest` â€“ our star data structure

CUPS has plenty of C structures, and in pycups3 I wrapped many of them into Python `dataclass`es. The key one is **`cups_dest_t`**, represented as a Python class named `cupsDest`.

To make things consistent, I created a base class `cupsBaseClass`, which provides two essential methods:

* `cffi_new` â†’ allocates memory in C.
* `cffi_free` â†’ frees memory (though [as per docs,](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using.html#working-with-pointers-structures-and-arrays) CFFI usually handles this anyway).

Each subclass (like `cupsDest`) defines three extra attributes:

* `ffi_name` â†’ the C type name.
* `ffi_free` â†’ the C function to free memory for this type.
* `ffi_value` â†’ the raw `CData` object.

Hereâ€™s the Python version of `cups_dest_t`:

```python
@dataclass(repr=False)
class cupsDest(cupsBaseClass):
    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return str(_bytes_to_value(self.ffi_value[0].name))

    @property
    def instance(self) -> Optional[str]:
        return _bytes_to_value(self.ffi_value[0].instance)

    @property
    def options(self) -> Dict[str, cupsOption]:
        return cupsOption.from_cffi_list(
            opts=self.ffi_value[0].options, count=self.ffi_value[0].num_options
        )

    @property
    def is_default(self) -> bool:
        return self.ffi_value[0].is_default

    ffi_name = "cups_dest_t"
    ffi_free = "cupsFreeDests"

    @classmethod
    def from_cffi_list(cls, dests: "cupsDest", count: int) -> "Dict[str, cupsDest]":
        results: Dict[str, cupsDest] = {}
        for i in range(count):
            new_dest: Any = dests.ffi_value[0][i]
            results[str(_bytes_to_value(new_dest.name))] = cupsDest.from_cffi(
                dest=new_dest
            )

        return results

    @classmethod
    def to_cffi_list(cls, dests: "Dict[str, cupsDest]") -> Any:
        count = len(dests)
        c_dests = _ffi.new(f"cups_dest_t[{count}]")

        for i, (_, dest) in enumerate(dests.items()):
            c_dests[i].name = _ffi.new("char[]", dest.name.encode("utf-8"))
            c_dests[i].instance = _ffi.new(
                "char[]",
                dest.instance.encode("utf-8") if dest.instance is not None else b"",
            )
            c_dests[i].is_default = dest.is_default
            c_dests[i].num_options = len(dest.options)
            c_dests[i].options = cupsOption.to_cffi_list(dest.options)

        return c_dests
```

This class makes it super simple to move between Python and C worlds. For example, helper methods like `from_cffi_list` and `to_cffi_list` make it possible to convert lists of printers back and forth.

And since itâ€™s a `dataclass`, I donâ€™t need to write boilerplate `__init__`s â€” less code, more sanity.

## Wrapping it up

So yeah, between **CFFI wrappers**, **Python dataclasses**, and **enum simplifications**, weâ€™ve got a design thatâ€™s:

* Easier to understand,
* Easier to extend,
* And much less scary than raw C extensions.

Of course, this is just scratching the surface. There are *lots* of other details â€” structures, enums, mixins, helpers â€” and things can get really complicated if you let them.

But if I had to sum it up: these three pillars â€”

1. **Connection + Mixins**
2. **Dataclass wrappers for C structures**
3. **Simplified enums**

â€” are the heart of the new pycups3 architecture.

And yes, the work is still ongoing. So stay tunedâ€¦ or better yet, stay caffeinated. â˜•
